this is a readme. you can read it.

my biggest obstacle(s) with this project were my personal time constraints and lack of testing. this last week has been pretty rough for 
me; family stuff, multiple tests, feeling slightly physically ill, the rush to finish oracle production before distribution, and my rep part
have all made it so that i was unable to work on the code and test it as much as i would have liked to. in fact, you might even note that my 
code is *extremely* unideal. i apologize in advance for making your brain hurt, unless you are reading this after attempting to analyze my
dumpster fire of a program, in which case i apologize after the fact.

given more time and more optimal conditions, i think i would have been able to do a lot better and quite easily make a program that actually works. this is
from the most complicated robot i've programmed, as ms granlund's poe class last school year did quite a lot of controls work(in robotC and not java,
but that's a pretty minor difference). i have pages of notes on sensors, circuits, motors, PID, and other concepts that ms granlund threw at us. it was,
without a doubt, my favorite unit in poe.
